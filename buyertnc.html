    <p>Cydene Express is a mobile app for ordering gas &amp; diesel services wherever you are; it 
communicates requests to the closest energy vendors in the area who have been registered in the Cydene  system through DPR and allows the user to choose which service provider delivers. The private limited company Cydene Energy Services Limited (registry code 1326840), is the holder of rights and service provider of the Cydene Express App.
</p>
		



  <h3>Using the Cydene Express</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The use of Cydene Express requires installation of the software and registration of a user account. During the installation of Cydene Express, the mobile number of the Cydene Express service user is linked to the respective user account and added to the database.
    </li>

    <li>
      When using the Cydene Express app, the user can choose whether he/she wishes to pay for the cash to the vendor or use credit card. 
    </li>

     <li>
      Any complaints can be sent to our support team via email express@Cydene.com or by calling our support line +234-908-111-5555 (available on workdays &amp; Saturdays 08.00-17.00) 
    </li>

      <li>The user can pay for the energy service with a credit card payment, which requires the prior activation of the credit card data within the app and acceptance of Cydene Express Terms and Conditions. </li>

      <li>Mobile payments can be made by a user of the Cydene Express app who has concluded a mobile payment agreement.</li>

      <li>When making credit card and mobile payments, the receiver of the payment is Cydene Express, who forwards the received payment to the energy vendor. When making credit card and mobile payments, a service free is added per each order of energy service. The named service fee includes payment commission fees, incl. Visa / MasterCard service fees. The amount of the service fee is displayed in the mobile app. In the event that the mobile payment intermediary enacts a fee for the usage of the payment service, which has to be paid by the customers separately, then the named fees are not included in the Cydene Express credit card and mobile payment fee.
</li>

  <li>The contact for Cydene Express credit card and mobile payment support service is: express@Cydene.com and phone number +234-908-111-5555. Inquiries submitted by e-mail shall receive a response within one business day. Cydene Express shall resolve all credit card and mobile payment related complaints and applications within two business days. When offering credit card and mobile payments, Cydene Express acts as the economic agent of the vendors by intermediating payments made in the Cydene Express app. The obligation of the customer in front of the vendor shall be considered fulfilled as of the moment when the payment order is made for the payment of funds into the Cydene Express bank account. Cydene Express shall not be responsible for the exercise of the customer’s payment order.
</li>



  </ul>







  <h3>Ordering or cancelling a energy service</h3>
  <ul>
    
    <li>If the Cydene Express app user orders a service or product and the vendor has confirmed the receipt of service order then the service is considered pre-ordered.
</li>

  <li>Cancelling an ordered service is considered to be the situation where the vendor has notified about the receipt of an order and the Cydene Express app user waives the energy service after receipt of the notice.
</li>


<li>Cancelling an ordered energy is also considered to be the situation where the user of the Cydene Express app or people whom the energy was ordered for do not appear in the location within 8 minutes as of the time when the vendor notified them about the arrival of the vehicle in its destination.
</li>


<li>In case of cancelling the energy service the Cydene Express app user has to pay N250 as a penalty fee. In the event that the Cydene Express user notifies about the cancelling of order within 5 minutes as of receiving of the notification concerning the receipt of the order through Cydene Express, the user does not have to pay the penalty fee.
</li>



<li>We have the right to revoke the right to use the app if the user has waived the use of service on 3 successive instances in one 24 hour period. In that case the app notifies the user about the number of cancellations and after waiving the 3rd time, Cydene Express cancels the usage right. 
</li>


<li>Cydene Express usage right can be cancelled for up to six months. After that the user can reactivate his/her user account by contacting the local team via email. 
</li>



<li>The use of the Cydene Express app is based on a non-exclusive license issued by Cydene Express. The license agreement is valid for a non-limited period and is free of charge for the customer. In case of any faults in the software, we shall endeavor to correct them as soon as possible, but please keep in mind that the functioning of the app may be restricted due to occasional technical errors and we are not able to guarantee unlimited faultless functioning of the app at all times. We shall also accept no liability for any losses incurred as a consequence of the Cydene Express app not functioning or not being usable in the desired manner. In the event that the customer’s right to use the app is cancelled, the corresponding non-exclusive licence shall also be repealed.
</li>


<li>As the Cydene Express app is a means of communication between customers and service providers, Cydene Express cannot influence or take any responsibility for the quality or defects of the service. For this reason, we are unable to guarantee consistently accurate and faultless provision of energy services located via Cydene Express. </li>


<li>The consumer’s right of refund (withdrawal) is not applied to Cydene Express app orders.
</li>

<li>By registering an account with Cydene Express, a customer shall accept the following conditions. </li>

<li>Cydene Express shall have the right to add the personal data of the app user to the Cydene Express database and to forward the personal data to energy service providers in accordance with Cydene Energy’s Privacy Policy.

<h3>Good practice of using the Cydene Express app
</h3>



<ul>
  
  <li>As Cydene Express is not a provider or broker of the energy service, we are unable to influence the quality of the energy service. Any issues with defects or quality of the energy service shall be resolved in accordance with the rules and regulations of the energy service provider or the relevant supervisory authority.</li>


  <li>Cydene Express is committed to contributing to improvement of the quality of energy services. For this reason, we ask to fill out a feedback form in the Cydene Express app. This enables us to offer suggestions to the energy service providers for improving the quality of their service. 
</li>



<li>We expect that the users of the Cydene Express app use the app in good faith and are respectful of the vendors who offer their services through Cydene Express.
</li>


<li>Cydene Express shall make every effort to ensure that only DPR registered vendors, who have integrity and are respectful of their profession and customers, use the Cydene Express app. However, we are in no position to guarantee that every provider of energy services, located via the Cydene Express app, satisfies the aforementioned criteria at all times. If you experience objectionable energy service, please notify the company responsible for the service, a supervisory authority or our support team. Cydene Express shall reward customers with a discount code for every new unique user they invite to use the app. The reward code will only be valid if the new user uses Cydene Express’s mobile payments for the first service. Cydene Express has the right to void any discount codes and block user accounts if it suspects any fraudulent activities and charge the user for the damages caused.
